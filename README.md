# wavChunks

Sample splitting proof of concept running completely in the browser

## Motivation

This is an experimental piece of a larger project (samplekiller.com)[samplekiller.com]. I needed to get sample splitting working in the browser, but it was such a big feature that I needed to develop it separately.

## Installation

1. git clone REPO
1. cd REPO
1. npm install
1. npm run dev

## Usage

Upload a short wavefile of samples you've recorded and it will generate clips of the file for you
